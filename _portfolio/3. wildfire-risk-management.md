## Project Overview

This interdisciplinary research project addresses the critical challenge of extreme wildfire risk in California, developing innovative approaches for risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and power system resilience enhancement.

## Research Focus Areas

### Wildfire Risk Modeling
* Advanced machine learning techniques for wildfire prediction
* Integration of meteorological, topographical, and vegetation data
* Real-time risk assessment and deicision-making framework

### Power System Resilience
* Optimization of Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS)
* Grid hardening and infrastructure resilience strategies
* Distributed energy resource integration for enhanced reliability

<!-- ### Policy and Management Strategies
* Coordination between utilities and emergency management agencies
* Community resilience and evacuation planning
* Economic impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis -->

## Technical Innovation

* **Data-Driven Approaches**: Integration of satellite imagery, weather data, and utility infrastructure information
* **Optimization Algorithms**: Advanced optimization and AI/ML models for decision support
* **Multi-Scale Analysis**: From local community impacts to statewide policy implications
* **Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborative approach with utilities, agencies, and communities

## Key Achievements

* Development of innovative wildfire risk prediction models
* Optimization frameworks for public safety power shutoffs
* Policy recommendations for state and local agencies
