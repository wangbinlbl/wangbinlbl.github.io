## Project Overview

This interdisciplinary research project addresses the critical challenge of extreme wildfire risk in California, developing innovative approaches for risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and power system decision-making framework.

## Research Focus Areas

### Wildfire Risk Modeling
* Advanced machine learning and AI techniques for wildfire prediction
* Integration of meteorological, topographical, and vegetation data
* Real-time risk assessment and deicision-making framework

### Power System Resilience
* Optimization of Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS)
* Grid hardening and infrastructure resilience strategies
* Distributed energy resource integration for enhanced reliability


## Technical Innovation

* **Data-Driven Approaches**: Integration of weather data (both measured and simulated), and utility infrastructure information
* **Optimization Algorithms**: Advanced optimization and AI/ML models for decision support
* **Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborative approach with utilities, agencies, and communities


## Collaborative Network

* **Academic Partners**: UC Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
* **Research Institutions**: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

## Funding Details

* **Funding Agency**: University of California Office of the President (UCOP)
* **Award Amount**: $500K over 3 years (LBNL portion)
* **Co-Principal Investigators**: Multi-million multi-campus collaboration across UC system
* **Project Period**: 2019-2024
