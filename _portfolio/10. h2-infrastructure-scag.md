## Project Overview

This project develops comprehensive hydrogen and battery charging infrastructure planning strategies for medium- and heavy-duty fuel cell electric vehicles within the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) territory, supporting the region's transition to zero-emission commercial transportation.
<!-- 
## Research Objectives

### Infrastructure Assessment
* **Current State Analysis**: Evaluation of existing hydrogen production, distribution, and dispensing infrastructure
* **Demand Projections**: Forecasting hydrogen demand based on vehicle adoption scenarios
* **Gap Analysis**: Identification of infrastructure gaps and deployment priorities
* **Economic Viability**: Assessment of costs, financing mechanisms, and business models

### Strategic Planning
* **Spatial Optimization**: Optimal location analysis for hydrogen stations and production facilities
* **Phased Deployment**: Timeline and milestones for infrastructure rollout
* **Policy Integration**: Alignment with regional transportation and air quality plans
* **Stakeholder Coordination**: Multi-agency collaboration framework

## Technical Approach

### Modeling and Analysis
* **Network Optimization**: Mathematical models for optimal infrastructure placement
* **Supply Chain Analysis**: End-to-end hydrogen production, distribution, and dispensing
* **Integration Assessment**: Coordination with electric vehicle charging infrastructure
