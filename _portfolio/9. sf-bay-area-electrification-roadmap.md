## Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive electrification roadmap for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area, providing strategic guidance for infrastructure deployment, fleet transition strategies, and regional coordination.
<!-- 
## Regional Focus

### San Francisco Bay Area Context
* **Multi-County Region**: Coordination across 9 counties and numerous jurisdictions
* **Diverse Fleet Operations**: Port operations, last-mile delivery, regional freight, transit
* **Environmental Leadership**: Aggressive climate goals and air quality standards
* **Economic Significance**: Major logistics hub with significant freight movement

### Strategic Importance
* Model for urban freight electrification in complex metropolitan regions
* Integration with existing sustainability and transportation planning efforts
* Coordination between multiple air quality management districts
* Alignment with state and federal electrification policies

## Research Components

### Infrastructure Planning
* **Charging Network Design**: Optimal placement of charging infrastructure across the region
* **Grid Integration**: Assessment of electrical grid impacts and upgrade requirements
* **Multi-Use Facilities**: Shared charging infrastructure for different vehicle types
* **Technology Integration**: DC fast charging, depot charging, and wireless charging solutions

### Fleet Transition Analysis
* **Adoption Scenarios**: Multiple pathways for fleet electrification based on different policy and market conditions
* **Total Cost of Ownership**: Economic analysis for different vehicle classes and duty cycles
* **Fleet Operator Engagement**: Direct collaboration with major regional fleet operators
* **Financing Mechanisms**: Analysis of incentives, grants, and financing options

### Regional Coordination
* **Multi-Jurisdictional Planning**: Coordination framework for regional agencies and local governments
* **Policy Integration**: Alignment with existing transportation and air quality plans
* **Stakeholder Engagement**: Comprehensive outreach to industry, government, and community groups
* **Environmental Justice**: Ensuring equitable deployment and community benefits

## Technical Methodology
