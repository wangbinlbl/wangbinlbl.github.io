## Project Overview

HEVI-LOAD (Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicle Infrastructure - Load Operations and Deployment) is a comprehensive modeling framework developed to support national-scale infrastructure planning for medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicle charging networks.

## Technical Approach

* High-performance computing implementation for large-scale agent-based simulations
* Integration of real-world vehicle movement patterns and charging behaviors
* Advanced optimization algorithms for infrastructure placement
* Comprehensive load forecasting, grid integration and infrastructure need analysis
* LLM integration to accelerate the scenario analysis

## Project Impact

* Supports federal and state policy decisions for electric vehicle infrastructure
* Provides quantitative analysis for utility planning and grid modernization
* Enables coordinated deployment strategies across multiple stakeholders
* Contributes to national decarbonization and electrification goals

## Funding and Timeline

* **Principal Investigator**: Bin Wang
* **Funding Agency**: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
* **Award Amount**: $1.5M
* **Project Period**: 2022-present

## Collaborations

* Federal, state transportation agencies and utilities
* Industry partners in transportation and energy sectors
