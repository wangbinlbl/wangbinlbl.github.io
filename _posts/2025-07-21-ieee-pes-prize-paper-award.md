I will attend the 2025 IEEE PES General Meeting at Austin Texas in July 2025. I'm thrilled to share the "2025 IEEE PES Prize Paper Award" for the wildfire summary paper led by Prof. Can Huang.

This recognition highlights the importance of our collaborative research on wildfire mitigation strategies and their critical role in power system resilience. The awarded paper represents a comprehensive review of public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) for wildfire mitigation, examining policies, practices, models, and data sources that inform utility decision-making during high wildfire risk periods.

## About the Award

The IEEE PES Prize Paper Award is one of the most prestigious recognitions in the power and energy systems field, acknowledging outstanding contributions to the advancement of electric power engineering. Our paper's selection reflects the growing importance of wildfire risk management in power system operations and planning.
