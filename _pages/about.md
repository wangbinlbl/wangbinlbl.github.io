My name is Bin Wang. I'm a computational research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Welcome to my personal site!

I lead a multi-displinary team at LBNL to develop models/tools in the following topics:
- Medium and Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicle Charging/Refueling Infrastructure Planning (HEVI-LOAD)
- Wildfire Risk Modeling, Mitigation and Management Strategies to Enhance Grid Resilience
- AI and High Performance Computing Technologies for Electric Vehicle, Electric Grid and Transportation Systems

You can check my current and past projects in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).
